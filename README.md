# Imdb-Heatmap
[Website](https://mokronos.github.io/imdb-heatmap) that shows heatmaps of ratings of tv show episodes.

# Idea
The idea for the site come from this [Website](https://vallandingham.me/seriesheat/#/). My main issues with the site were speed (its annoying to search) and that its not up to date.

# How it works
The python script downloads the data from imdb and saves the top 2500 shows(for now) as one {title, id} json file.
It then generates json files for every one of those IDs, containing the ratings of every episode for every season.

The scripts run every 24h via a cronjob through github actions. The json files are then pushed to the repo.

The website is pretty much pure vanilla js. It loads the {title, id} json file and lets the user search through it. Then loads the other jsons according to the search/selection.

# Issues
Dataset generation takes way too long (1h48min) for 1000 shows. Currently using pandas to combine the databases. Takes a while to figure out which of the IDs are actually shows, and to collect all the IDs of the episodes. Probably can be optimized.

Series "Married... with Children" doesn't get generated.
Probably because of the first unrated pilot episode.

Need to manage duplicates in the dataset. Currently there are 2 "The Office" series, one can't be accessed.
Could add year and/or force selection.
